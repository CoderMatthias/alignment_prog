# alignment_prog
Combine pairwise alignments to create better alignment

This program takes a fasta file containing the D. mel protein and the known orthologs, splits them into D. mel and species ortholog file, runs a pairwise alignment using 'muscle', and reassembles the pairwise alignments one by one for a more accurate alignment.
